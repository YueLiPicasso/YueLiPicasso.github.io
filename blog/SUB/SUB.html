<h1 class="western">1.
Two's Complement Interpretation</h1>
<p>
Given a sequence of bits, it is natural to interpret it as a binary
unsigned integer. Then we have (unsigned) addition and subtraction defined for
the bit sequences in the usual way. The CF (carry flag) is set if there is a carry
(for addition) or a borrow (for subtraction).</p>

<p>
Two's complement is a way to interpret an unsigned integer as
encoding a signed integer. The name &quot;two's complement&quot; is
historical and may not make sense in the modern context (see my
<a href="../tcm.pdf">earlier blog</a> explaining the name &quot;two's compliment&quot;).</p>
<p>
However, two's compliment is convenient since it does not
require anything more special to do addition and subtraction for
signed integers than those algorithms for unsigned integers. We shall
see that unsigned integer subtraction results are often reusable and
are actually reused as results of signed subtraction.</p>

<h1 class="western">2. Signed
Subtraction is just Unsigned Subtraction</h1>
<p>
Let us now draw a table by hand on a piece of paper (I'm reusing kids' sketch paper), for unsigned
binary integer subtraction, and then look at the bits in the table
as if they are two's compliment encoding of signed integers, and see
how much sense it makes. For simplicity, but without loss of
generality, we work with unsigned integers of 3-bit long.</p>

<p>
  In the table, I compute X minus Y by regarding X and Y as unsigned integers. The
table has 8 columns and 8 rows, filled firstly using a thin black pen
with the possible values of X and Y and the results of their unsigned
subtraction.</p>

<p>
Next I use a green highlighter to mark the lower left corners
of those cells that have the CF (carry flag) set - these are results
obtained when Y is above (i.e. larger than) X (both are interpreted
as unsigned integers). I also intended to use an orange highlighter
to mark the upper right corners of those cells that has the OF
(overflow flag) set, but this is impossible before interpreting the
cells as two's complement signed integers. So I instead use an orange
highlighter to write down in each cell the corresponding two's
complement interpretation in decimal, and assess which of the results
are still correct and which are not, and I use a pink highlighter to
circle all the incorrect (overflow) results.</p>

<p>
Overflow happens when the true result is outside the range of signed
integers representable under a given bit length. For 3-bit signed
integers, this range is from -4 (minus four) to 3. I make a mistake
when circling the cells, and draw short thin strikes on the wrong
circle.</p>

<p>
We observe that although the table is for unsigned
integer subtraction, most (those that are not in pink circles) of the
results still make sense when the bits are reinterpreted as
two's compliment signed integers. Hence we get our first question
answered: <i>to do subtraction for two's complement signed integers,
just do subtraction as if the bits denote unsigned integers</i>.
</p>

<p>
Although the results are not always correct (overflow gives
incorrect results), at least overflow is signalled by the OF, and
after all, even unsigned subtraction may have truncated results (when
CF is set). We have seen that about half of the unsigned subtraction
results have CF set. We now ask how much of signed subtraction has
OF set?</p>

<h1 class="western">3. A Quarter of
  Signed Subtraction Overflows</h1>

<p>
I want to exercise my table drawing skill with longer bit sequences.
If every sequence is 1cm long, my notebook allows me to list 32 of them
in a row. So I draw a new 32 times 32 table for subtraction of
unsigned 5-bit integers.</p>

<p>
I get lazy when I find there are too many cells to fill.
However, I discover laws that render the table logically
structured, so the entries become predictable.</p>

<p>
Firstly, the leftmost column is easy to fill, for it is
subtracting from zero, or sign reversing. The top row is also
trivial, for it is subtracting zero. After that, the main diagonal
from top left to bottom right can be uniformly filled with zeros.
What is important is that each minor diagonal that is parallel to
the main diagonal can be filled uniformly, and numbers from
neighbouring diagonals differ by 1. For this reason we can easily
determine the number in a given cell by tracing the diagonal that
contains it towards the top-left end, which resides in either the
leftmost column or the top row, which we already easily filled. I use
 pink colour to highlight two diagonals.</p>

<p>
There are two diagonals, and one column and one row, which are
special and all of which correspond to the bits 10000. We
shall call them collectively as the min-negative borders, for 10000
represents the smallest negative integer under two's complement
interpretation. The overflow zone is
exactly the bow-tie shaped area, highlighted in yellow, enclosed by
the min-negative borders. The area of the overflow zone is exactly a
quarter of the entire table if you imagine that you cut off the two
triangular components of the zone and align their sloping edges to
make a rectangle, which is a quarter of the table.</p>

<p>
Now we have an idea of how often overflow of signed
subtraction happens - we start from an unsigned subtraction table,
then we reinterpret the bits, and mark the overflow zone, and
finally conclude that it is a quarter of the entire table. Other
places in the table are correct signed subtractions.</p>

<h1 class="western">4. The OF=SF
Equation for Signed Integer Comparison</h1>
<p>
The SUB instruction modifies the OF (overflow flag) and the SF
(sign flag). The JGE conditional jump instruction performs a jump if
the two signed integers in a prior subtraction has the
greater-than-or-equal relation, and this is verified by checking the
equation OF=SF. We now prove that OF=SF after SUB X, Y if and only if
X is greater than or equal to Y. Again we work with a small bit
length. This time we not only highlight the overflow zone but also
mark the SF-set zone (orange left cell border), and the less-than
zone (green right cell border).</p>

</figure>
<p>
It is clear that whenever a cell has green mark (for less-than
relation between X and Y), it has exactly one of the OF and SF marks
(meaning OFâ‰ SF); otherwise if a cell has no green mark (for
greater-than-or-equal), either it has both, or it has none of the OF
and SF marks (meaning OF=SF).
